					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Rusty Lake is an indie game studio, based in Amsterdam. Since spring 2015 we develop surrealistic adventure games that take place in the Rusty Lake universe. The studio consists of two people: Robin and Maarten. </p>
					</br>
					<p>Inspired by the humor and uneasiness of David Lynch's TV series Twin Peaks we decided to create our own imaginative world called Rusty Lake. We started out with the eerie and surrealistic Cube Escape series. We tried to add something new to the point-and-click genre by creating a lot of suspense and atmosphere in an "escape room" setting. All chapters are somehow connected which each other and every installment reveals more about the Rusty Lake mystery. 
					We have released nine Cube Escape episodes which are free to play on iOS, Android and Web. The reason why they're free is because we wanted to build a community next to our games, our goal is to have fans eagerly waiting on a new chapter just like a tv series. </p>
					</br>
					<p>The upcoming years we have a lot more in store for you, the Rusty Lake universe will expand with both free and premium games! </p>
					</br>
					<p>We also want to thank our awesome community! Thanks to their support we made it so far. The Rusty Lake characters are really becoming alive because of our fans. Fan art, cosplaying and even a Rusty Lake tattoo... We are also very honored to be part of this. </p>
					</br>
					<p>Stay tuned for all Rusty Lake updates on our blog, social media and newsletter. Let us know if you have any questions: info@rustylake.com. Tag your fanart with #rustylake on social media to get featured! </p>
					</br>
					<p>Hope you have a pleasant stay in Rusty Lake! </p>
